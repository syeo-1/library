- simple library that keeps track of the books you've read

things I learned about:
- how to implement local storage to save data on user's computer
- creating javascript objects and using prototypes
- creating forms and using form data to render tables in the DOM
- learned about using classes vs plain constructors

things to improve on for future projects:
- continue modularizing code
- continue improving on code reusability
    - some functions could be reused

things improved from last project: (calculator):
- code reuse
- no use of many boolean flags
